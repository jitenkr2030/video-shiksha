$ eslint src --ext .ts

Oops! Something went wrong! :(

ESLint: 8.57.1

ESLint couldn't find the config "@typescript-eslint/recommended" to extend from. Please check that the name of the config is correct.

The config "@typescript-eslint/recommended" was referenced from the config file in "/home/z/my-project/apps/worker/.eslintrc.json".
